In todays video we are going to learn how to upload a video to YouTube using the right setting.

## **Step 1 Login to your YouTube account**

First things first make sure you are logging into your YouTube account.

If you do not have an account yet go ahead and create one. Once you are logged in, click on the top right corner, and click on YouTube Studio.





## **Step 2** **Select Upload YouTube video**

At the top right corner, select the camera looking icon and select upload video to begin the uploading process.

## **Step 3. Choose your video file**

Now you can select the video file or you can drag and drop the file. YouTube support majority of video formats so compatibility will not be a big issue, however, I would recommend having your video in mp4 for the best compatibility. Also just remember that, the larger the file, the longer it will take to upload your video depending on your internet speed.

## **Step 4. Fill in Video details**

While your video is uploading, take a few moments to fill in the necessary details.

***Title***: add a compelling title, it should be descriptive and importantly clickable. (I am not gong to go in dept on this.

***Description***: make sure you write a detailed description, as this helps with SEO and YouTube better understands your video and serve them to the right audience.

***Timestamps***: Additionally, use timestamps in the description to guide viewers through different sections of your video; this help viewers know what part of your whole video means what and helps viewers skip to various sections to get value and also helps with overall SEO when someone searches in google.

***Thumbnail***: Up next, let’s upload a thumbnail. make sure you have your catchy thumbnail ready when you are uploading your video.

***Playlist***: next is selecting a playlist for your video. It is always a good idea to group your videos into playlists based on similarities. This is very useful as YouTube can recommend videos from a particular playlist for a viewer who enjoys a particular video.

***Not made for kids***: Make sure to check it is not made for kids. This is very crucial, if you do check it is made for kids, YouTube will disable the comment section on your video and that is not the best, as they will be looking to also share your video to demographics of people who fall within this range. IT IS NOT MADE FOR KIDS.

**Check the automatic captions and key moments**, it cannot hurt like that.

***Last but not least is adding relevant tags to your videos***. This can be a little tricky but you want to add tags that will mostly be popping up in the search box when you are searching. So if the title of the YouTube video is how to upload a video to YouTube, some common tags would include first your name and that of your channel as you want some SEO for it, then you would have to follow with “how to”, “upload a video to YouTube” “YouTube”… you get what I mean by now.

***Category***: what category does your video fall into? is it a comedy skit? is it a how to and tutorial video? there are a few options available so you can go through and select the one that applies to your video.

**VIDEO ELEMENTS**

***Subtitles***: Do you have subtitles for your video? if you do, then upload it. this help YouTube to be able to recommend your videos to demographics who might not speak your language used to shoot the video but can read the subtitle to understand your video.

***I always recommend adding some cards***. For instance in the video, if you did make connection to another video on your channel, make sure to add the card to that video not only in the description but also as a card.

***End Screen*:** when your video is ending, it is always a great thing to recommend some videos for viewers to continue watching from your channel. this you can do with end screens. you have the option to select particular videos, playlists, or allow YouTube to select the best video for the viewer.

***VISIBILTIY***.

Select public if you do want your video to go up live right away, you can use schedule to maintain more consistency on your channel. if you do check private, this video will be uploaded but will only be available to selected few or those with a link to the video.
