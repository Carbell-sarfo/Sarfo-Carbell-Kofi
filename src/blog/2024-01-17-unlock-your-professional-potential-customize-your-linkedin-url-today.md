Welcome back, career enthusiasts! In today's tutorial, we're diving into the world of LinkedIn to show you how to make a lasting impression by customizing your LinkedIn URL.

# ðŸš€ **Why does it matter?** 

Well, in a competitive job market, a stellar CV alone might not cut it. Employers value candidates who go the extra mile, and that includes having a polished online presence, complete with an easily accessible LinkedIn profile.



# âœ¨ **Benefits of a Custom URL:**

* Boosts your online brand and presence.
* Enhances your credibility among peers and potential employers.



# **Let's get started with the steps:**

## **Step 1: Log In**

* Head over to your LinkedIn profile and click on the 'Me' icon.

## **Step 2: Edit Your Public Profile & URL**

* On the right-hand side, locate and click on "Edit public profile & URL."

## **Step 3: Customize Your URL**

* A new window, "Public profile settings," will open.
* Find the "Edit your custom URL" section on the right-hand side.
* Next to a pencil icon, you'll see your current URL. Click on the pencil to make your edits.



**Pro Tip:** Choose a custom URL that aligns with your personal brand. It could be your first or last name, or for consistency, make it the same as your other social media handles.

By having a customized URL, you not only make it easier for people to find and connect with you, but you also leave a lasting impression.
